						<p id="learnmore-expand">Oil and gas power the modern world of transportation, agriculture, manufacturing, computing, medicine, and education. Affordable and reliable energy makes possible every daily comfort we take for granted and serves as the lifeblood of our global economy. The oil and gas sector’s far-reaching importance cannot be overstated even though it is frequently underappreciated.<br /><br /> Fundamentally, energy production requires understanding where resources are located and how to extract them cost-effectively and safely. Over the last decade, it has become possible to deploy low-cost computerized sensors, reliable wireless networks, and flexible cross-platform software-as-a-service to measure, analyze, and produce more efficiently and safely. Together, these new technologies will reshape the oil and gas industry: drilling, completion, maintenance, and stimulation will be driven by the gathering and analysis of data. Consequently, oil and gas producers will need to reinvent themselves as data-driven companies.<br /><br /> Tachyus delivers the end-to-end technology to make that possible. Our platform ingests the deluge of new data from these ubiquitous networks of real-time sensors and integrates seismic, drilling logs, cores, completion designs, production data, and maintenance records so decision-makers can rapidly analyze all relevant context. Our breakthrough technology <i>Data Physics</i> combines physical modeling and machine learning to empower engineers to quickly predict mechanical equipment failure, production responses to stimulation, relationships between completion design and initial production, and fieldwide forecasts for any given injection redistribution. Ultimately, the Tachyus platform enables operators to explore millions of scenarios and identify optimal operational and development plans, resulting in significant cost reductions and production increases.<br /><br /> We provide oil and gas producers the technology required to make data-driven decisions.</p>
